The country's really getting too concerned about the debt ceiling.  The old folks will get their SS checks & who cares if they don't anyway?
Sometimes I wonder if I really should have taken this job it sure can get stressful.
This health care discussion has me thinking...It was President Roosevelt who 1st messed up health care
I hope Congress does not provide health care.  Like everything else, I believe the market can provide better solutions that the govenment.
I haven't twittered in a while.  Been very busy.  Did some traveling recently.  I think I like the president of France.
My family's really enjoying our dog.  I'm very glad we decided to get a dog.  It's a nice day.  Maybe I'll take the dog for a walk.
Trade's opening up with Cuba.  I'm really excited.  Free trade's good for citizens of both countries.  Plus I like their cigars
Protsters in London, GM may file banckruptcy...It has been a difficult week and It's only Weds.
It's abot 12:30 at night.  I better get to sleep.  I got about 3 hours sleep last night and a hour "power nap" this evening.
I went out to dinner this evening with my wife and now I'm going to relax and watch some T.V.  Hopefully something funny is on.
I'm going over some files or tomorrow and then relaxing beore going to bed.  I've got an early day tomorrow.
Right now just catching up on morning news and spending some time with the family

Outside of the Chimera Ant climax, he has my favorite moments of #HunterXHunterNow Shingo Takagi wants in the G1 Climax. These new entrants are going about the way I expected. If Shingo enters, then Will Ospreay HAS to enter. #njdominionBuffon came through the youth system at the Serie Aclub and made 220 appearances across six seasons before joining Juventus in 2001 for a world-record fee of €52 million (£46m/$59m).Other than losing 34 Ranked Seasons points on a "network error," we had quite a bit of fun tonight between MLB and Twitch Sings.

https://t.co/dsB8tpEM8dAre your answers right in front of you? Are the things we seek already within our grasp?

he is in a big imagination that they are good Bjp is bad actually people thinks in reverse way
BJP is good
congress is bad
it is better in the part of rahulgandhi to know this and take decisions properlyIs this still populism or already political banditry?
